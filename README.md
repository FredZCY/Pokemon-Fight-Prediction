# Introduction to Data Science (EN.553.636) Group Project
Group member: Yuchen Yao, Qixin Wang, Margaux Tian, Shuangning Yang, Chenyu Zhang  

We choose Pokemon Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) to be our dataset which includes 721 Pokemons with 18 different types: Normal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, Ghost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, Dark and Fairy. The dataset has 13 features(attributes) described as:
- ID for each pokemon
- Name (Name of each pokemon)
- Type 1 (Each pokemon has a type,which determines weakness/resistance to attacks)
- Type 2 (Some pokemon are dual type)
- Total (Sum of all HP, Attach, Defense, SP Atk, SP Def, Speed)
- HP (Health points of each pokemon)
- Attack (The base modifier for physical attacks)
- Defense (the base damage resistance against normal attacks)
- SP Atk (special attack)
- SP Def (the base damage resistance against special attacks)
- Speed (determines which pokemon attacks first each round)
- Generation (when did the pokemon came out)
- Legendary (special, rare pokemon, usually with high total)

We also use Pokemon- Weedle's Cave Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge) which contains the results of previous combats, and the combination of those two datasets help develop Machine Learning models able to predict the result of future pokemon combats.
